# Stoic Practice

Stoicism is not a philosophy of detachment. It is a discipline of attention —
learning to see clearly what is within your power and what is not, and acting
accordingly without complaint.

## Morning Reflection

The Stoics began each day with a short mental rehearsal. Before rising, Marcus Aurelius
would remind himself:

> "When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be
> meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly."

This is not pessimism. It is preparation. By expecting difficulty, you are not caught
off guard by it. You meet it with equanimity rather than frustration.

A morning reflection of five minutes is enough. Ask yourself:

- What obstacles might I face today?
- What virtues do I want to practise?
- What am I grateful for?

Write the answers down. The act of writing slows thought and makes it honest.

## The Discipline of Perception

The Stoics held that it is not events that disturb us, but our judgements about them.
Epictetus stated this plainly: "Men are disturbed not by things, but by the opinions
about things."

The discipline of perception means catching yourself at the moment of interpretation.
Between stimulus and response there is a gap. Your work is to widen that gap.

When something difficult happens, pause before labelling it as bad. Ask:

- Is this truly harmful, or does it only feel that way?
- What part of this is outside my control?
- What would a reasonable person do here?

This is not passive acceptance. It is active clarity.

## Evening Journal

End the day with a short review. The Stoics called this the *examination of conscience*
— not to judge yourself harshly, but to learn.

Three questions suffice:

1. What did I do well today?
2. What could I have done better?
3. What will I do differently tomorrow?

Keep it short. Five minutes is enough. The goal is honest observation, not elaborate
analysis. Over time, this practice builds the habit of self-awareness that Stoic
philosophy demands.

## Voluntary Discomfort

Seneca recommended occasionally choosing hardship — going without heat, sleeping on a
hard surface, eating plain food — not as punishment but as training.

> "Endure poverty for a few days. Eat little, dress roughly. Then ask yourself: is this
> the condition I feared?"

The point is to discover that what you fear is manageable. Voluntary discomfort shrinks
anxiety about the future. You know from experience that you can handle difficulty.

Start small. One cold shower. One skipped meal. One afternoon without distraction.
The practice does not need to be dramatic to be effective.
