# On Writing

Good writing is thinking made visible. The page reveals how clearly — or unclearly —
you understand a subject. If your prose is tangled, your thinking is tangled.
Clearing up one clears up the other.

## The Discipline of Brevity

Most writing is too long. First drafts are especially guilty of this: redundant
qualifications, throat-clearing introductions, sentences that say the same thing twice
in slightly different words.

The rule is simple: if a word is not doing work, remove it. If a sentence repeats
what the previous one already said, delete it. If a paragraph meanders without
arriving anywhere, cut it.

Hemingway's advice — "write one true sentence" — is more than aphorism. Start
with the most honest, direct statement of your idea. Build from there. Do not
begin by positioning or hedging or signalling sophistication. Begin with the thing itself.

The reader's attention is finite and valuable. Respect it.

## Clarity Before Elegance

Elegance is not the enemy of clarity, but it must come second. A beautifully
constructed sentence that obscures its meaning is a failure. A plain sentence
that delivers its meaning precisely is a success.

Read your sentences aloud. If you stumble, your reader will too. If you have
to reread a sentence to understand it, rewrite it.

Jargon is a particular danger. Technical terms have their place — precision often
requires them — but they are frequently used to avoid the harder work of
explaining something plainly. When you reach for a technical term, ask yourself:
could I say this another way to someone unfamiliar with the field?

If yes, say it that way first.

## Rewriting Is Writing

The first draft is not writing. It is raw material. The writing happens in revision.

This is not discouraging — it is liberating. The first draft does not need to be
good. It needs to exist. Give yourself permission to write badly in order to have
something to improve.

A useful revision process:

1. Write the first draft without stopping to edit.
2. Leave it for at least a day.
3. Read it aloud, marking anything that sounds wrong.
4. Cut ruthlessly. Aim to reduce the word count by a quarter.
5. Revise for clarity, then for rhythm.

Repeat steps three through five until it is ready. There is no fixed number of
passes required. The work tells you when it is done.

## On Audience

Every piece of writing has a reader in mind, even if that reader is only yourself.
Knowing your reader — their knowledge, their concerns, what they will find obvious
and what they will need explained — is the foundation of good communication.

The most common failure is writing for no particular reader: a vague, imagined
audience that requires the writer to explain nothing and assume nothing, resulting
in prose that is both overcrowded with context and strangely empty of insight.

Pick a specific person. Imagine writing to them. Your writing will immediately
become more direct, more useful, and more human.
