# Systems Thinking

Most problems are not caused by bad people or bad intentions. They are caused by
bad systems — structures that produce predictable, unwanted outcomes regardless
of who operates them. Understanding this is the beginning of systems thinking.

## What a System Is

A system is a set of elements connected by relationships, organised to produce
a function or outcome. A company is a system. A city is a system. A conversation
between two people is a system.

Every system has three components:

- **Elements** — the visible parts: people, departments, infrastructure, stock
- **Connections** — the rules, flows, and relationships between elements
- **Purpose** — what the system actually does, not what its designers intended

The most important of these is purpose. A hospital's stated goal is to heal patients.
But if its funding depends on occupied beds, its actual purpose may be to keep beds
full. Systems behave according to their structure, not their mission statements.

## Feedback Loops

Systems are governed by feedback. A feedback loop exists when a change in one
part of a system circles back to affect the same part.

**Reinforcing loops** amplify change. A company gains customers, gains revenue,
invests in marketing, gains more customers. Growth feeding growth. These loops
produce exponential behaviour — in both directions. A run on a bank is a reinforcing
loop running in reverse.

**Balancing loops** resist change. A thermostat detects that a room is cold,
activates the heater, and turns off when the target temperature is reached.
All goal-seeking behaviour involves a balancing loop.

Most systems contain both types. Understanding which loops dominate a system
under which conditions explains most of its behaviour.

## Delays

Delays are among the most misunderstood features of systems. When the connection
between cause and effect is separated in time, people often cannot see the relationship.

A student works hard but sees no improvement for weeks. She concludes the effort
is not working and stops. The improvement arrives shortly after — but she is no
longer working. The delay misled her.

Delays cause oscillation. An economy overheats; policymakers raise interest rates;
the rate rise takes eighteen months to affect inflation; impatient policymakers
raise rates again; eventually the economy slows sharply. Boom and bust is largely
a delay problem.

## Leverage Points

Donella Meadows, whose book *Thinking in Systems* remains the clearest introduction
to the field, catalogued the places where intervention in a system produces the
greatest effect.

Her counterintuitive finding: the most obvious interventions — adjusting numbers,
changing parameters — are usually the least effective. The most powerful leverage
points are:

1. The goals of the system
2. The rules of the system
3. The power to change the structure of information flows
4. The mindset from which the system arises

Changing a law changes the rules. Changing what data is collected changes
information flows. Changing what a society values changes the goals. These
interventions are harder to implement but far more durable in effect.

## Seeing Systems

The shift from event-thinking to systems-thinking is a perceptual change.
Event-thinking asks: what happened? Systems-thinking asks: what structure
produced this event, and will continue producing it?

This shift is uncomfortable. It distributes blame more widely and removes simple
heroes and villains. It suggests that fixing a problem requires changing a structure,
not punishing or replacing individuals. And it demands patience — systems change
slowly, and the effects of intervention are often delayed.

But it is a more accurate picture of how the world works.
