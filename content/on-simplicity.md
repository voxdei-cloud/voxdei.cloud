# On Simplicity

Complexity accumulates. Systems grow. Rules multiply. Products gain features.
Interfaces become cluttered. Organisations add layers. This happens without anyone
deciding it should happen — it is the default tendency of things built over time
by many hands with many intentions.

Simplicity, by contrast, requires active effort. It is always a choice, and always
a costly one.

## The Cost of Complexity

Every feature added to a product must be designed, built, tested, documented,
maintained, and supported. The tenth feature does not cost ten times the first
feature — it costs more, because it must coexist with the nine before it and
the hundreds that follow.

The same principle applies to organisations, codebases, legal frameworks, and
personal schedules. Complexity compounds. The cognitive overhead of understanding
a system grows faster than the system itself.

This is why complexity is almost always the enemy of reliability. Simple systems
fail in simple, understandable ways. Complex systems fail in ways that nobody
anticipated, because the interactions between their parts create emergent
behaviours that no individual designer foresaw.

## Essentialism

Essentialism — the disciplined pursuit of less — is not about doing less for its
own sake. It is about doing the right things, at full effort, without dilution.

The essentialist question is not "Can I fit this in?" but "Is this the most
important use of this resource?" Resources are not only time and money. Attention,
energy, and the coherence of a product or organisation are also finite.

Saying no is the primary tool. Not an apologetic, qualified no, but a clear one.
Every yes is implicitly a no to everything else that time or energy could have
served. Making the trade-off explicit is the beginning of honest prioritisation.

## Simplicity in Design

Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's remark is often quoted: "Perfection is achieved not
when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."

This applies to writing, software, architecture, and any designed artefact. The
simplest solution that solves the problem is almost always the best — not because
simplicity is aesthetically pleasing (though it often is), but because it is easier
to understand, easier to maintain, and easier to extend.

The trap is mistaking simplicity for ease of production. Simple outcomes are often
harder to produce than complex ones. A short, clear letter takes more time to write
than a long, qualified one. A minimal interface requires more design decisions than
a cluttered one, because each element must carry its weight.

## Living Simply

The same logic applies to personal life. A schedule with margin is more productive
than a packed one, not despite the empty space but because of it. A home with fewer
possessions is easier to maintain and move through than one full of things that
require attention.

This is not asceticism. It is not a moral argument for renunciation. It is a
practical observation that every object, commitment, and obligation exerts a
small but real cognitive and physical cost. Curating these costs — deliberately
choosing what earns its place in your life — produces clarity.

The simplicity to aim for is not sparse or barren. It is sufficient: enough to
do the work, support the life, sustain the relationships that matter — and no more
than that, because more than that gets in the way.
